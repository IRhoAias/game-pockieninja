# Set this to 1 if you want the server to disable writing to the db.
# This is an "oh shit!" flag. In case it turns out that in production
# we are pounding the stats db too hard, you can set this to 1, restart
# the server, and all requests sent to the server will just be dropped
# on the floor.

#server.dbWritesOff=1
# The following two settings deal with switching back and forth beween
# writing to the db and writing to disk. If the queue gets too big
# (qsize > highWatermark) the server will write out all requests to
# a data file to be processed later (currently manual, but the hope
# is to make this automatic in the future). When the queue size drops
# below lowWatermark, then it will write to the db again. It is much
# faster writing the requests out to a file than to the db, especially
# when the statsdb machine is being stressed. The low default to 25k,
# the high to 30k.
