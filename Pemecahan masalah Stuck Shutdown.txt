Peter says:
 1. please make sure all services are done before you restart service all
Oik Oiks says:
 you mean all service shutdown first?
Peter says:
 right
 2. if you are suspicious of lic error
 just go to d:/op/script/
 and click restart7001.bat and restart7002, restart7003.bat
 to check if there is lic error
Oik Oiks says:
 i already do that when i get first lic... there is warning "cannot find lic" like that
 its mean lic is error?

Peter says:
 only two things what I mentioned in the group talking window
Diky says:
 haha .. yes iknow that step, but oik ask me .. he run the proses but still not working 
 whats wrong ?
Peter says:
 not sure . if he did not stop all the service , just click stopsrv-normal.bat again
 if there are only interior service , policy service are on, you could just kill them all
 how to know which services are on?M
Diky says:
 how to kill them all with stopsrv.bat
Peter says:
 in command mod , tasklist|grep java   to check the process ID
 and then in command mod , netstat -aont|grep "process ID"
 if the ports are 8999 or 843 that means the according services are interior and policyM
 please do not click stopsrv.bat first
 because if the game or gamedb service are running when you run stopsrv.bat, that will make rollback
Diky says:
 i see 
 must stopsrv-normal.bat right 
 if not worked or have stuck just see at tasklist|grep java   to check the process ID

Peter says:
 yeah, it's most safe
